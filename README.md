## Background Theory
Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to design and develop complex systems that incorporate multiple components and functions. Mechatronics systems are prevalent in many applications, including manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and robotics.
The development of mechatronics systems involves the integration of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and other electronic components to control the mechanical systems' behavior. The design of mechatronics systems requires a comprehensive understanding of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering principles and their interaction to create a reliable and efficient system.
In the case of the submarine mechatronics project, the integration of PIC microcontroller and PLC technology was used to control various submarine systems, including the radar and sonar system, motor control, threat detection system, and internal condition monitoring. PIC microcontrollers are commonly used in mechatronics systems for their flexibility and ability to handle complex control algorithms. On the other hand, PLC technology is known for its reliability and robustness in controlling mechanical systems.
The simulation of the submarine mechatronics system allowed for the assessment of both the PIC and PLC systems' performance in controlling the submarine systems. This project aimed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both technologies in controlling the submarine systems and determine which technology is better suited for specific tasks and applications.
Submarines are underwater vehicles designed for a wide range of applications, including military, scientific, and commercial purposes. These vehicles can operate at great depths, and their design is critical in ensuring their safety and efficiency in underwater environments.
The typical design of a submarine includes a cylindrical hull that provides buoyancy and stability, with various compartments for storage, crew quarters, and equipment. The submarine's propulsion system includes electric motors, which are powered by batteries or diesel generators, and a propeller that allows the submarine to move through the water. Submarines also include various sensors, such as sonar and radar, to detect objects and hazards in the surrounding environment.
The integration of mechatronics systems in submarines can greatly enhance their capabilities and efficiency, allowing for the control and monitoring of various systems within the vehicle. The design and development of mechatronics systems for submarines require a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's systems and the principles of mechatronics engineering.
Mechatronics systems are vital in modern technology and have a wide range of applications. The integration of PIC microcontroller and PLC technology in the submarine mechatronics project allowed for the creation of a complex and efficient system. The assessment of both technologies' performance in controlling the submarine systems will provide valuable insights into the design and development of future mechatronics systems.
